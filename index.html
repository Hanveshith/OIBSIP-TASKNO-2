        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie, born Maria Salomea Skłodowska, was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who won two Nobel Prizes. She was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland.</p>
        <p>Curie is best known for her pioneering research on radioactivity, which led to the discovery of two new elements: polonium and radium. Her work laid the foundation for the development of nuclear physics and radiotherapy.</p>
        <p>Despite facing numerous challenges and discrimination as a woman in the male-dominated scientific community of her time, Curie's perseverance and dedication to her research were unparalleled. She conducted her experiments in a small, poorly equipped laboratory and even carried out her research during World War I, operating mobile radiography units to provide X-rays to wounded soldiers.</p>
        <h2>Legacy and Achievements</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie made significant contributions to science and paved the way for future discoveries. Here are some of her notable achievements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First woman to win a Nobel Prize: In 1903, Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics, which she shared with Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel.</li>
          <li>Discovery of new elements: In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered polonium, named after Marie's home country Poland, and radium.</li>
          <li>Second Nobel Prize: In 1911, Marie Curie received her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry through the discovery of radium and polonium, the isolation of radium, and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.</li>
          <li>First female professor at the University of Paris: In 1906, Curie became the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.</li>
          <li>Research on radiation therapy: Curie's work in radioactivity paved the way for advancements in radiation therapy, which is used in the treatment of cancer.</li>
          <li>Establishment of the Radium Institute: Marie Curie founded the Radium Institute in Paris, which became a major center for scientific research.</li>
          <li>Authorship of scientific papers: Curie authored numerous scientific papers throughout her career, contributing to the scientific understanding of radioactivity.</li>
          <li>Posthumous recognition: Curie's contributions to science and society continue to be recognized even after her death. Her name and legacy live on through various awards, scholarships, and institutions named in her honor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Marie Curie's groundbreaking work continues to inspire scientists and women in STEM fields around the world.</p>
        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie married Pierre Curie in 1895, and they had two daughters named Irène and Ève. Both daughters went on to have successful careers in scientific research.</p>
        <h2>Final Years and Death</h2>
        <p>In her later years, Marie Curie faced health issues due to long-term exposure to radiation. She passed away on July 4, 1934, in Sancellemoz, France, from aplastic anemia, likely caused by her prolonged exposure to radioactive materials.</p>
        <p>Despite her untimely death, Marie Curie's contributions to science and her legacy continue to inspire future generations of scientists and researchers.</p>
        <h2>Honors and Recognition</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie received numerous honors and awards throughout her lifetime, including:</p>
        <ul>
